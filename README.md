### Project: Recipes

This is first project for HTML and now CSS practice. This is a simple recipe website with basic HTML and a little CSS styling. It consists of main index page which has links to some of the recipes. The design I strive for is the look and feel of sticky notes.

Skills:

- Basic HTML
- Basic CSS
- Git
- GitHub
- ZSH shell usage in terminal
